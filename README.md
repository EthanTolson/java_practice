# Overview

DESCRIPTION:
This is a very simple music player that takes midi files and plays them.

PURPOSE:
My main purpose was to go practice OOP in Java and to learn the syntax of the language. I started with simple programs and eventually built this. 

I wanted to learn Java and decided to do something with music. I originally planned to take the notes from the midi files and do something with them but decided to make a simple music player instead.


{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
